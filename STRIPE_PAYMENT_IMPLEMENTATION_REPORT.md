- JSONB fields for flexible metadata storage
- Timestamp tracking for all operations
- Cascade deletion for data integrity

## Design Notes

### Architecture Pattern
- **Clean Architecture**: Service layer separation with dependency injection
- **Event-driven**: Webhook-based subscription state management
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models for usage tracking

### Security Implementation
- **Webhook Verification**: Stripe signature validation for webhook security
- **Raw Body Parsing**: Proper handling of webhook body for signature verification
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and API limits
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation
- **Authentication**: Firebase token verification for all endpoints

### Credit System Design
- **Dual-tier Generation**: Pro (GPT-4o) vs Draft (GPT-4o-mini) generations
- **Overage Allowance**: 50% overage with additional charges
- **Automatic Reset**: Billing period-based usage reset automation
- **Usage Warnings**: 80% and 95% threshold notifications

## Subscription Plans

### Plan Configuration
1. **Free**: 20 draft generations/week, no Pro generations
2. **Starter ($9/month)**: 100 Pro + unlimited draft generations
3. **Creator ($15/month)**: 200 Pro + unlimited draft (Most Popular)
4. **Pro ($24/month)**: 400 Pro + unlimited draft + analytics
5. **Teams ($59/month)**: 1,500 Pro + unlimited draft + 3 seats + priority support

### Plan Features
- 7-day free trial for all paid plans
- Advanced analytics for Pro and Teams
- Priority support for Teams plan
- Automatic plan upgrades/downgrades with proration

## Webhook Event Handling

### Processed Events
- `customer.subscription.created` - New subscription setup
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Plan changes and status updates
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Cancellation processing
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Successful payment handling
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Failed payment recovery
- `customer.updated` - Customer information sync
- `payment_method.attached` - Payment method notifications
- `checkout.session.completed` - Checkout completion

### Event Processing
