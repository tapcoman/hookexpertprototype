**Key Endpoints/APIs**
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | /api/payments/plans | Returns available subscription plans |
| POST | /api/payments/checkout | Creates Stripe checkout session |
| POST | /api/payments/billing-portal | Customer portal for managing subscriptions |

## Design Notes

**Pattern Chosen**: Clean Architecture with Service + Repository layers
- `StripeService` handles all Stripe API interactions
- `StripeWebhookService` processes webhook events
- Database layer manages subscription and usage data
- Frontend components use React Query for state management

**Data Migrations**: Existing schema already supports complete payment system
- `subscription_plans` table with Stripe integration fields
- `payment_history` table for transaction tracking  
- `usage_tracking` table for credit system management
- `webhook_events` table for event processing audit trail

**Security Guards**: 
- Webhook signature verification for all Stripe events
- Firebase authentication required for all payment endpoints
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting on generation endpoints
- HTTPS requirement for webhook endpoints

## Credit System Implementation

**Plan Configurations (Updated to Match Requirements)**:

| Plan | Price | Hooks/Month | Features |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 10 | Basic formulas, Community support |
| **Starter** | $9 | 100 | All formulas, Email support, 7-day trial |
| **Creator** | $15 | 300 | Priority support, Analytics, 7-day trial |
| **Pro** | $24 | 1,000 | Advanced analytics, Performance insights |
| **Teams** | $59 | Unlimited | 3 seats, Team collaboration, Priority support |

**Usage Enforcement**:
- Credit checking before each hook generation via `StripeService.checkGenerationLimits()`
- Automatic usage recording via `StripeService.recordGeneration()`
- Monthly usage reset via webhook `invoice.payment_succeeded` events
- Overage handling with 50% buffer before hard limits

## Webhook Event Handling

**Complete Subscription Lifecycle Management**:
- `subscription.created` - Initializes usage tracking and user premium status
- `subscription.updated` - Handles plan changes and status updates
- `subscription.deleted` - Downgrades to free plan and resets limits
- `invoice.paid` - Records payment history and resets monthly usage
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Updates subscription status and triggers retry logic

**Event Processing**:
- Webhook signature verification for security
- Idempotent event processing to prevent duplicates
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- Event storage for auditing and debugging
