## Design Notes

**Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with repository pattern  
- Service layer for business logic (`psychologicalHookGenerator`)
- Utility layer for database operations (`db/utils`)
- Configuration layer for environment management (`db/config`)

**Data Strategy**: JSONB for flexible psychological data

- Psychological strategy metadata and performance analytics
- User preferences and learning adaptation data

**Performance Optimization**:
- 25+ strategic indexes for query performance
- Connection pooling with environment-specific configurations
- Query monitoring and performance tracking
- JSONB optimization for psychological data

**Security Implementation**:
- Parameterized queries preventing SQL injection
- Environment-specific connection security (SSL in production)
- User data relationship constraints with cascade deletes
- Input validation with TypeScript strict mode
